    <h3>Here is the list of interesting facts about Shinjuku:</h3>
    
    <div class="container-fluid" style="max-width:50%;">
       <ul class="text-left" style="display:inline-block;font-size:1.1em;">
         <li>Just west of the station many of Tokyo’s tallest buildings rise skyward. In the “skyscraper district,” visitors can see over two dozen of the city’s highest structures</li>
         <li>Shinjuku is the most international part of Tokyo, with more than 10 percent of its 328,000 residents hailing from outside Japan.</li>
        <li>Japan loves Godzilla — and Shinjuku is no exception. In fact, the Hotel Gracery has the one and only official Godzilla head statue in the country on top of its building</li>
        <li>Nearly 5 million people passing through Shinjuku and enjoying a meal are bound to do a little shopping, don’t you think? In fact, over the course of a single year, Shinjuku businesses conduct over ¥1.1 trillion in purchases[ — or just over US $10 billion.</li>
        <li>According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Shinjuku station is officially the busiest train station in the world, where every day 3.4 million passengers utilize six different train companies operating across 12 different lines.</li>
